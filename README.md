# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project, Excel was utilized to digest and visualize large amounts of data to formulate an effective fundraising campaign strategy for the client. Basic Excel functions from filtering, formatting, and freezing were implemented to view the data. Pivot tables and pivot charts were utilized to visualize and drill down pertinent fundraising data points important to the client. The final product will allow our client to visualize similar campign outcomes based on launch date and goals.
  
 ### Purpose
 To provide the client with an analysis and visual representation of like campaign outcomes in correlation with launch date and goals. Providing information to the client regarding the best and worst months to start a fundraising campaigns. The data will also provide the client with goal setting guidelines, allowing the client to align fundraising goals with similar, successful, categorical campaigns. 
 
## Analysis and Challenges
Basic Excel functions and formulas were utilized to resize the dataset based on the client's desired parameters. The initial raw dataset included information from multiple countries and multiple fundraising categories and subcategories. The data was filtered and separated to allow for an analysis of similar capaign types, category specificity, regional, seasonal, and outcomes. Due to the size of the dataset and the manual analytical dependencies, this analyis could result in multiple errors. This Kickstarter_Challenge analysis was successful, provding the client with the desired informaiton in a digestible format.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Utilizng the information compiled and analyzed it is safe to determine the client's fundraising goals will be most successfull if started in the spring or early summer. December would be the worst month to launch a fundraiser

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Loftier and higher monetary goals don't pay off. Campaigns with goals of $45,0000 or higher failed 83% or more of the time. Campaigns with lower goal amounts, $4,999 or lower were succesfull 73% of the time.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The most challenging portions of this challenge have been encountered when interfaing with Git and Github. 

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
---  May through August are the months in which the most theater fundraisers are launched.
---  The highest percentage of failed theater fundraisers launch in December. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
---  Less is more. Campaigns launched with smaller goals are more succesful than campaigns with higher goal amounts. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
---  The dataset was limited in donor demographic information. The data set lacks geographic specificity. While it is helpful to have the country of the fundraiser, a more indepth analysis and visualization of this data could be provided if even country and region were included. Regional information could also provide insight into the donors themselves. Additional information regarding theater genre would also help the client make an informed fundraising roadmap. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
---  A pivot table analyzing Outcomes Based on Average Donation would be helpful providing additional insight to how the client may market to potential donors. A   stacked column bar graph breaking down successful, failed, and canceled fundraising campaigns and average donation amounts.
